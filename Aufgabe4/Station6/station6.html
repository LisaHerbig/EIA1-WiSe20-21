                <p> You know Dasher and Dancer and Prancer and Vixen
                    Comet and Cupid and Donner and Blitzen

                <p>The most famous reindeer of all?
                    Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
                    Had a very shiny nose </p>
            </div>
            <div class="song3">
                <p> And if you ever saw it
                    You would even say it glows
                    All of the other reindeer
                    Used to laugh and call him names </p>
            </div>
            <div class="song4">
                <p> They never let poor Rudolph
                    Join in any reindeer games
                    Then one foggy Christmas Eve
                    Santa came to say</p>
            </div>
            <div class="song5">
                <p> "Rudolph, with your nose so bright
                    Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?"
                    Then how the reindeer loved him...</p>
